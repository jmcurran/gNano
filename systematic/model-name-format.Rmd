## Models - distribution of the response
The first 1-2 letters indicate distribution so that `ln` is log-normal, and `g` is gamma. This is the distribution of the peak height. Note that the log-normal models assume that the peak heights have been log-transformed in the data prep step.

## Models - effects
Each model is labelled 0-4. The models are incremental in that the effects added in the present model(s) are in the current model. These numbers represent:
    0.  No effects, just modelling peak heights with one central distribution
    1.  Profile effect added.
    2.  Locus effect added.
    3.  Dye and Dose effects added.
    4.  Template effect on variance
